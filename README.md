Webpage that includes a detailed description of our design submission to Innovation Jam Hackathon - Hackworks.

We focused on User Research, User Testing, and multiple rapid prototype iterations to vaidate our product. As a result we propose a solution to the brief that aligns with what users want, and can be easily integrated into their daily life.

Our brainstorming was completed on Figma. https://www.figma.com/file/gFLwEUBgsbAG3U3YuyPR8U/Co-Caregiving-App?node-id=0%3A1
Our wireframes were completed on Adobe XD. https://xd.adobe.com/view/57c747d0-5c9e-4634-b9de-347453f75c0b-0294/
Our high fidelity prototypes were created on ProtoPie. 
Our webpage was built using HTML & CSS.
