          <h2>THE CHALLENGE STATEMENT: <br><br><span class="lighter">How might we help older adults stay in their homes longer while maintaining their independence in a safer, healthier, and more cost-effective way. <br><br>Older adults want physical, mental and financial freedom; reduce environmental risk and support mobility; keep treatable health issues in check and identify new risks early; and sustain relationships with friends and family to maintain mental health.</h2></span>

      <div class="card">
            <h2>INSIGHT:<br><br><span class="lighter">Research suggests that while genetics contributes up to <span>one-third of diseases of premature aging</span>, we are responsible for the rest of the two-thirds. <br><br><span>Tongue diagnosis</span> is a non-invasive assessment long used in alternative medicines to gain insight on a greater understanding of an individualâ€™s <span>overall health</span>. Using emerging technologies, we can provide health recommendations based on these findings along with a short questionnaire, and <span>Ayurvedic knowledge</span> (one of the world's oldest forms of whole body healing) on consistiutions, to enable users to have access to personalized information quickly and empower them with dietary and exercise recommendations based on a <span>thousand-year-old evidence-based medicine practices for general health improvement.</span><br> <br>
              Traditional Chinese Medicine and other Eastern philosophies of health also consider <span>emotions as a major contributor for internal causes of disease.</span>

          <h3>Who we exist for</h3>

            <h2>ELEMENTS OF THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <P>Older adults are <span>less likely to report psychiatric symptoms</span> and more likely to emphasize physical complaints. Some signals of <span>mental health decline</span> in seniors include: confusion, disorientation, depressed mood, social withdrawal, thoughts of suicide, unexplained fatigure, etc.</P>
            <p>57% of <span>adults are confused about what healthy eating means.</span> This confusion is greatly influenced by the media. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)'s theories, <span>foods are an important and inexpensive source of therapy</span> for sustaining health and treating disease.</p>
            <p>Digital products <span>discriminate against seniors</span> and fail to meet both accessible design and an inclusive content strategy. De-prioritization of designing interfaces and experiences for people with disabilities may be due to lack of awareness to the issues of accessibility or is attributed as the responsibility of a small subset of the design community.</p>

            <h2>WHY USE AI/ML TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM?</h2>
            <P>Data-driven approaches to healthcare decision support enable healthcare professionals, caregivers, family, and the user, to understand, learn, and plan for interventions, based on the daily data provided by the user regarding their physical and mental health and wellness.</P>
            <p>A conversational AI/ML model for mental health support enables users to monitor and reflect on their mental health trends over time and empower users and their families / caregivers to make more informed decisions regarding their care. <br><br>A custom computer vision model provides an alternative to long and detailed nutrition intake forms. By auto-populating data regarding the user's physical characteristics, in addition to a short questionnaire, the user is better able to access reliable nutrition information suited to their needs faster than surfing the web for generic advice. It also provides an opportunity for those who would not have had readily-available access to a nutritionist or health professional, to receive information necessary to make better decisions to improve their health.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence can play a key role in innovation and is well-known in its usefulness in measurement. In this case, the models act as non-invasive form of care treatment that tracks and predicts the user's mental and physical health trends, and notifies caregivers of "red alert" patterns and activities, enabling older adults to maintain their independence as they age. </p>

            <h2>DATA, DATA ACQUISITION, AND MEASURES OF SUCCESS</h2>
            <h3>MICROSOFT AZURE - LUIS.AI</h3>
            <P>LUIS.AI is an off-the-shelf solution that can be quickly trained on various types of conversations. We want users and their support systems to know the context of the user's feelings and mental health so we use the Key Phrase Extraction solution to locate vulnerable / "red alert" phrases in the user's conversations with the journal. Success is in accuracy of alerts to support system (indicated via in-app survey regarding accuracy, targeted towards receivers of alert)</P>
            <h3>CUSTOM COMPUTER VISION + IMAGE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <P>Microsoft's off-the-shelf computer vision model would be trained using our custom labeled data that was tested and trained on the Appen platform. A specific set of instructions was developed and updated to enable Appen's human annotators to sort through and correctly label a large set of images. Full body images of people are collected in-house and sourced externally. Success is high precision because we want no false negatives / false positives</P>
            <h3>REWARD SYSTEM</h3>
            <P>Success is a monthly increase of 10% in daily active users. This shows that users are engaging with the app regularly, indicating that they are remaining consistent with their healthy habits.  </P>

            <h2>GUIDED GRATITUDE JOURNAL</h2>
            <P>Users are prompted to record daily guided gratitude journals via video or speech. The technology will be able to detect key words / phrases and populate these into easy-to understand mental health progress charts for the user and their support system to view. If the technology detects a decline in mental health in the user's journal entries (example, red alert phrases: "I'm feeling depressed", "I've been having suicidal thoughts", "I often think of death", etc.) the technology will send the user's support system an alert to take action.<br><br> Progress charts will also show the user predictions regarding their mental health trends, in an effort to motivate users to continue building the habit of expressing, and reflecting on, gratitude daily.<br><br> Users also have the option of sending video entries directly to loved ones. </P>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>INTAKE & MEAL PLAN</h2>
            <P>Rather than filling out long intake forms in order to receive a personalized meal plan, the user will follow the technology's prompts to upload a photo or take a photo within the app. The technology will then extract data from the image and the user's inputs to recommend a custom meal plan, backed by evidence-based research. <br><br>Users are recommended to follow the meal plan for at least 7 days - and are prompted to provide feedback on their experience, in order to inform future meal plan developments. <br><br>For example: if the user felt very sick after eating a certain meal, the technology will learn to not provide this same meal to the user. Over time, the model will learn dietary preferences, predict likability of certain foods, and suggest recommendations.    </P>

            <h2>The Lean Start-Up Methodology</h2>
            <p>Our team wanted the best possible solution out of our 4-week Innovation Jam challenge, so we adopted the Lean Start-Up Methodology. </p>
            <h3>60%</h3>
            <p>Sixty percent of our product development was dedicated to user research. Our team dug deep into the core of what older adults wanted for their future.</p>
            <h3>76%</h3>
            <p>We prioritized usability testing. This accounted for seventy-six percent of our product development. We had 6 different versions of our prototype that ran through many iterations of user testing to ensure our final product meets our users' needs.</p>
            <h3>20+</h3>
            <p>Our team recruited over 20 unique users to test our prototypes before final production. We also allotted time to test for accessibility, relevance, and ease of flow.</p>
